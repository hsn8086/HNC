# HNC
## Introduction
HNC is a Minecraft server anti-cheat, it was made when I first learned to write java, after two rewrites, this version is the second rewrite when the development version, this rewrite aims to reduce the misjudgment, so ... The development progress was so slow that I didn't want to continue writing...

So this is still a half-finished product, if you are interested, you can look, or even continue to write.

In addition: the code is java to kotlin, there may be some problems.
